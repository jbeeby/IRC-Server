IRC Server Propsal

For this project, our goal is to set up an IRC server and we were given the option to use a raspberry pi. There werenâ€™t many rules leaving the project for us to come up with an idea and run with it.

Objectives:
  ~First I needed to understand what an IRC Server was and what it did.
  ~Second I would need to know how to set up a Raspberry Pi.
  ~Third learn how to burn an ISO file to a SD card
  ~Fourth I need to find the software needed to do this
  ~Fifth I need to set it up and see if it actually worked
  
I think this project will be interesting for the fact that I will be learning more about linux, how to set up and use a raspberry pi and also to finally understand more about IRC in general. After a quick cursery search i found a few resources that will help out alot. Between Wikipedia, pimylifeup.com and raspberrypi.org I should be able to accomplish this fairly well.


Web sites I'll be using to accomplish this task:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat
https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-irc-server/
https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/
